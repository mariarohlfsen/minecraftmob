# minecraftmob

This is a Minecraft passive mob detector. How it works is you download an image from the internet, or you can take a picture/screenshot in-game of a mob. Then, you use the terminal to input the name of the file of the image, and it will output the name of the animal. This is helpful for new players who want to know about a mob and its features.

I ran out of time for my project and only had a limited amount of time, but if I had more time I would give special facts about the mob if I could. 

I looked at the Minecraft Wiki for help on the list of passive mobs: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mob
