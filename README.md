# minecraftmob

This is a Minecraft mob detector. How it works is you download an image from the internet, or you can take a picture/screenshot in-game of a mob. Then, you use the terminal to input the name of the file of the image, and it will output the name of the animal. The point of this is just a fun way to see if the ai will pick up on the animal: is it realistic enough? 



I ran out of time for my project and only had a limited amount of time, but if I had more time I would try to get train the ai to only recognize minecraft mobs. 

I took many pictures from google and tested them out to see which mob would be correctly picked out by the ai.
